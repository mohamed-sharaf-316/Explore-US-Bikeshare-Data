# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
### CSVs files link : _https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o2glpqj4p00MxRW7Pi9ypFnHkNVXA1No?usp=sharing_
### Due to github file upload size restrictions, I uploaded the datasets used in the project on a public google drive link.
### Use the command prompt to engage with the Python code.
### The project starts with asking the user for input to specify the city to explore it's data (chicago, new york city, or washington)
### Then the user is asked to specify the month to explore or write _all_ to explore data for all months
### Then the user is asked to specify the day of week to explore or write _all_ to explore data for all days of week
### The user keeps getting asked to view 5 rows of data, as long as the user keeps entering _yes_ he would view 5 more rows of data, this ends when the user types _no_ or when the rows end
### The program then calculates some useful statistics for the user then prompts the user to restart the program with a _yes_ or _no_ answer
